"""Detect likely non-protein ligands from a PDB structure.

Separates biologically meaningful ligands (drugs, cofactors) from
crystallographic water and free ions that don't need the dashboard's
ligand tools. Never assumes the ligand is named "LIG" – the detection
is residue-name driven and accepts an explicit CLI override.

The water/ion residue sets live here (where they semantically belong)
and are re-exported from :mod:`fastmdxplora.live.structure_info` so
that :func:`structure_info.count_structure` can re-use them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    residue_keys
        Iterable of (chain, resname, resi) tuples. Typically produced by
        :mod:`fastmdxplora.live.structure_info` walking the PDB.
    explicit
        Optional iterable of residue names that should always be treated
        as ligands, even if they would otherwise be filtered out
        (e.g. ``{"LIG"}`` from ``--setup-ligand-name``). Explicit names
        *override* the water/ion/amino-acid filters.
    include_cofactors
        When True, common cofactors (NAG, GOL, SO4, ...) are also
        surfaced. Defaults to False so the ligand panel focuses on the
        chemistry-of-interest ligand.

    Returns
