"""Trajectory analysis phase.

This package implements FastMDXplora's analysis capability. The
analysis-level orchestrator (:class:`AnalysisOrchestrator`) coordinates
individual analysis modules, each a subclass of
:class:`~fastmdxplora.analysis.base.Analysis`.

The orchestrator architecture mirrors the design described in Aina & Kwan,
*J. Comput. Chem.* 2026 (DOI: 10.1002/jcc.70350), promoted from the trajectory
level to slot inside the project-level FastMDXplora pipeline.

Public API
----------

Top-level classes:

  :class:`Analysis`               -- abstract base class for analyses
  :class:`AnalysisResult`         -- result container returned by ``run()``
  :class:`AnalysisOrchestrator`   -- the analysis-level orchestrator

Helpers:

  :func:`load_trajectory`         -- load one or more trajectory files
  :func:`available_analyses`      -- list registered analysis names

Module-level constant:

  ``AVAILABLE_ANALYSES``          -- tuple of registered analysis names
                                     (lazy: reads the registry on access)

Examples
--------

Direct use of the analysis layer::

    from fastmdxplora.analysis import AnalysisOrchestrator

    ao = AnalysisOrchestrator("traj.dcd", topology="top.pdb")
    results = ao.run(include=["rmsd", "rg"])

# Force a non-interactive matplotlib backend before any submodule imports
# pyplot. FastMDXplora's analysis figures are always written to files, never
# shown, and MD typically runs on headless machines (CI, HPC clusters,
# servers) with no display. Without this, matplotlib tries an interactive
# backend (e.g. Tk) and crashes ("Can't find a usable init.tcl"). Set once,
# here, since this package is imported before any analysis module's pyplot.
