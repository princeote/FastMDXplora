"""Ligand / cofactor loading for protein-ligand systems.

This module validates and loads small-molecule ligands for parameterization
with the OpenFF small-molecule force fields (via ``openmmforcefields``'
``SystemGenerator``). It deliberately keeps the *loading/validation* concern
separate from the *system build* concern (which lives in
:mod:`fastmdxplora.setup.prepare`): here we turn a ligand file into a
validated OpenFF ``Molecule`` with a known net charge; the prepare step feeds
that molecule to the ``SystemGenerator``.

Supported input formats are SDF and MOL2 — the formats OpenFF reads cleanly
with full bond/charge information. (PDB ``HETATM`` extraction is intentionally
not supported yet; a bare PDB ligand lacks the bond orders OpenFF needs.)

The OpenFF toolkit is an optional dependency. :func:`load_ligand` raises a
clear, actionable :class:`LigandError` if it is not installed, rather than an
opaque ImportError, so the setup phase can degrade gracefully.
