"""PLUMED enhanced-sampling integration for the simulation phase.

PLUMED (https://www.plumed.org) adds collective-variable-based biasing and
analysis to an MD run — metadynamics, umbrella sampling, steered MD, and
free-energy methods. FastMDXplora wires it in optionally: when a PLUMED
script is supplied, its biasing forces are added to the OpenMM ``System``
before the simulation context is built, and PLUMED's output files (COLVAR,
HILLS, etc.) are redirected into the run's output directory.

The biasing is applied to the production stage only — equilibration (NVT/NPT)
runs unbiased, matching the standard enhanced-sampling protocol of
equilibrating the system before turning on the bias. The biasing force is
added to the OpenMM ``System`` just before production and the context is
reinitialized so it takes effect.

This integration is optional and degrades gracefully: without the
``openmm-plumed`` package installed, enabling PLUMED raises a clear,
actionable error rather than failing obscurely.
