"""Suppress raw C-level stdout/stderr from extension libraries.

Some C extensions — notably MDTraj's DCD/PDB molfile plugins — write
status messages straight to the operating-system file descriptors
(``dcdplugin) detected standard 32-bit DCD file ...``). Because the
writes happen in C, below Python, they bypass ``sys.stdout`` /
``sys.stderr`` and Python's logging entirely; only redirecting the
underlying file descriptors (1 and 2) intercepts them.

This module provides one context manager, :func:`suppress_native_output`,
used both by the trajectory loader (so real ``fastmdx`` runs stay clean)
and by the test fixtures (which build/read DCD files directly).

    """Redirect OS-level stdout/stderr to ``os.devnull`` for the block.

    Operates on the file descriptors themselves (``os.dup2``), so it
    catches output written by C extensions that bypass Python's stream
    objects. Crucially, it also flushes the C runtime's stdio buffers
    (``libc.fflush(NULL)``) *while the redirect is still in place*, before
    restoring the descriptors — without this, libc-buffered C output (e.g.
    MDTraj's plugin messages on macOS) leaks to the terminal after the
    descriptors are put back. Python-level ``print`` is also suppressed
    for the duration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stdout, stderr : bool
        Which OS streams to redirect. Both default to True because the
        target chatter has been observed on either stream depending on
        platform and how the terminal wired the descriptors.

    Notes
    -----
    Best-effort: if a descriptor can't be duplicated (e.g. it's already
    closed, as can happen under some capture setups), that stream is left
    alone rather than raising.
